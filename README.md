Purchase analysis with RFM

Answer the following questions:

1. How many users do we have who made a purchase only once?
2. How many orders per month, on average, are not delivered for various reasons (display details by reasons)?
3. For each product, determine on which day of the week the product is most often bought.
4. How many purchases does each user make on average per week (by months)?
5. Conduct a cohort analysis of users. Between January and December, identify the cohort with the highest retention for the 3rd month.
6. Build RFM user segmentation to qualitatively evaluate your audience. In clustering, you can choose the following metrics: R - time from the last purchase of the user to the current date, F - the total number of purchases from the user for all time, M - the amount of purchases for all time. Describe in detail how you created the clusters. For each RFM segment, plot the boundaries of the recency, frequency, and monetary metrics to interpret these clusters. An example of such a description: RFM-segment 132 (recency=1, frequency=3, monetary=2) has limits of recency metrics from 130 to 500 days, frequency from 2 to 5 orders per week, monetary from 1780 to 3560 rubles per week.
